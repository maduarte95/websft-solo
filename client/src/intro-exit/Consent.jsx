        We wish to invite you to participate in a study exploring the mechanisms of creative collaboration in an item naming task. Your participation involves performing a computer-based task in which you and a partner will be asked to name items from different categories within a time limit.

        By participating in this study, you will be contributing to the improvement of human-AI collaboration for creative tasks.
