          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>Score for both players is based on the total number of of items named together unique items submitted by you and your partner</li>
            <li>The screen will display all items named and the current score</li>
            <li>A timer will show the remaining time for each round</li>
            <li>Once your turn starts, an additional 20-second timer will be displayed. A penalty for slow responses will be applied every 20 seconds since the start of your turn.</li>
